# Dad Notes


Mortgage Advisor & Commercial Lending Officer
Commercial & personal residential lending & experience working with mortgages
Created in 1862
Before the 1920s, was difficult for people to confirm they owned properties
- Act as confirmation of land ownership
- Before 1920s, ownership was recorded in a set of documents owned by the property owners, which was not registered
- Lots of property disputes, duplicate deeds
	- Deed would be unclear as to what the property actually was
Led digitizing records and data management since 90s, when Lloyds had a fire and lost deeds and documents



Ownership
Freehold and leasehold
- Freehold - You own the property completely
- Leasehold - You own a right to live on the property, but don't own the property

On the title deed
- Different registers
	- proprietorship register - who owns the property
	- charges register - who has financial interest in the property
	- title register - who owns it, where it is, what it is

Accessed the charges registry for work using the web interfaces

Challenging new targets for newly built housing

## Why are you Interested in Working for HMLR

HMLR created in 1862 and solved property disputes
Before the 1920s, was difficult for people to confirm they owned properties
Property disputes, duplicate deeds, unclear deeds
Led digitizing records and data management since 90s, when Lloyds had a fire and lost deeds and documents
I know the HMLR has always been leading in digitization, accessibility and digital performance
My dad used to work as a Mortgage Advisor & Commercial Lending Officer, I asked him personally when I first started preparing about this role about his experience with using HMLR services, such as accessing charges registers, very high opinion
Very striking, that the first thing listed in 2022-2025 business plan was delivering an improved speed of service for your customers
I think being a civil servant is a very meaningful position, because it means you really are working for the people. I don't think you could look for more drive for a role
As a person with a crohnic illness I think I have an excellent understanding of what it means for Government digital services to be robust and there when you need them

# STAR Question

**SITUATION:** During my internship at Audioscenic, we were collecting data on different lenses and camera types for spatial audio speakers, but we lacked a way to visualize the data effectively.

**ACTIONS:** I took the initiative to develop a GUI data visualization program using Python Qt, which allowed us to better interpret and analyse the collected data using 3D spatial data visualization and frame-by-frame face landmark analysis.

**RESULTS:** My supervisors were impressed with the program, and it was adopted for internal use, enhancing our data analysis process.

# Please list any other academic or non-academic achievements

During my University experience and also my personal study I have generated a lot of notes for personal use, these notes are accessible on my personal website.

I’m proud of this project because it serves as both a learning resource for myself and a potential reference for others. I take my notes in Markdown format and use a static site generator to create the site, which I host on GitHub Pages (http://isaacklugman.com/Notes-Quartz/)

# Please describe your experience working as a team

In my second year of University, I was part of a team of five where we developed a JavaFX GUI for a fictional client to display SQL-loaded metrics whilst practising Agile Development techniques. Throughout this project, we created a project backlog to outline user requirements, held regular sprint reviews, and conducted frequent scrums, which fostered clear communication and ensured that everyone was aligned on our goals.

Later, in my fourth year, I worked on a more complex project involving multi-person 3D pose estimation. This required us to integrate data from an omni-directional camera and mmWave radars, and to visualize this data using Open3D. Collaborating in this project taught me the importance of flexibility and creative problem-solving, as we navigated technical challenges and ensured effective integration of our systems.

# Why have you applied for the role at **Blank**?

In addition, I’m particularly enthusiastic about the chance to work in a fast-paced, real-time environment where software reliability and performance have a direct impact on the day-to-day operations of the airport. My experience in agile development, data visualization, and system optimization would allow me to make valuable contributions to projects at Gatwick, especially those focused on improving data-driven insights and operational efficiencies. Overall, I believe that working at London Gatwick would be a fantastic opportunity to grow professionally while contributing to meaningful projects and also learning from my peers

# Please tell us about a time you had to learn a new skill, and describe the steps you took to make sure you successfully mastered the skill. What was the outcome

During my internship at Audioscenic, I was given the responsibility to develop analysis tools for head pose tracking. Although I had a strong foundation in Python, I had limited experience with the specific libraries needed, such as OpenCV and VTK for data visualization

My goal was to learn these libraries quickly and use them to build robust tools for visualizing tracking data in varied room positions and orientations, as this visualization was crucial to improving the system's accuracy

**Action:**

1. **Research and Training**: "I began by researching documentation and tutorials for OpenCV and VTK, identifying core features I’d need to master for this project."
2. **Hands-On Learning**: "After I gained a basic understanding, I applied what I learned by developing small prototype applications. This allowed me to experiment with different functionalities in a focused way and quickly troubleshoot issues."
3. **Seeking Feedback**: "I also checked in with my supervisor and colleagues regularly, showing them my progress to ensure I was on the right track and receiving feedback to improve my work."
4. **Refinement and Iteration**: "After developing the initial versions of the visualization tools, I continued refining the application, enhancing features based on user feedback and making it more efficient and user-friendly."

By the end of the project, I successfully created a set of tools that visualized tracking data accurately and were valuable for the team’s analysis process. Additionally, I gained proficiency in using OpenCV and VTK, which expanded my skill set and gave me the confidence to approach similar challenges in future projects."

# Share a skill or valuable lesson you learned from someone else and how you have applied that in your own life

Whilst working on group design projects at University, I learnt a lot of valuable time management skills. Whilst working on a Software Engineering Group project, we had lectures on project timeline management using Gantt charts, after designing and using a Gantt chart for that semester's project, I realised the value in effective timeline management – and I now practise these skills all the time in my own projects, especially when I am learning a new skill. Now, when developing my skills for a project, I prepare myself a timeline to allot myself a period for learning and development, and also provide myself milestones to measure my progress

# Tell us about a time you had to juggle competing priorities. What did you learn from that experience that you would bring to this programme

During my final year of University, we had a long-term Group Design Project that spanned the academic year in addition to ordinary modules. This required balancing priorities as the Group Project involved many responsibilities and the other members of the team were extremely dependent on me keeping up my pace. Simultaneously, I balanced revision and midterm/exam preparation for multiple other modules

My key learning points from this experience were strict time management techniques and learning to manage holding responsibility for an extremely important team effort. I learnt to partition my day into efforts over different projects, and to manage backlog of work to ensure that no project is falling behind

I believe that these skills would be highly transferrable to this program as time management, team working and backlog management skills are a necessity

# What’s the best example of teamwork you have experienced that you will bring to **Blank**

During my second year of University, I was a member of a team of five working on developing a Graphical User Interface in JavaFX with a SQL backend, to display advertising metrics for a fictional company. During the project, we created a project backlog to outline user requirements and held regular sprint reviews and scrums. Holding regular meetings and reviews proved invaluable for team-bonding and team management

I believe experiences like these are highly transferable to a team such as Gatwick. I have highly developed skills in bonding with team members and working towards a common goal. I believe team management skills such as backlog management and sprint reviews are also invaluable for working with a team in an IT programme such as Gatwick


# A positive workplace culture where our employees thrive is important to us. What values are most important to you in the workplace?

For me, maintaining ethical values, team morale and producing deliverables are most important to the workplace culture. When working with a team, I think it is important that all members of the team share a passion for the ethics of the project such as sustainability

Secondly, I believe that maintaing a positive team morale is integral to a successful project, through team bonding, respect and frequent communication. Team members should feel incentivised to assist each other and provide inspiration

Lastly, I believe that in order for a project to continue running, all members of the team need to respect and value the importance of maintaining consistent project deliverables. This is why I believe it is important for employees to be able to help and work with each other, since one team member falling behind means the whole project falls behind

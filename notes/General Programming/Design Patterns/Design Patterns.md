#design-patterns 

A design pattern is a reusable template for solving a recurring design problem based on design knowledge and is modifiable

%%[[Git Ignore/Heavy Stuff/Matthew Barnes Notes/Software Modelling and Design Notes.pdf#page=53&selection=34,0,36,37&color=yellow|Software Modelling and Design Notes, p.53]]%%

A design pattern should have low **coupling** (modules can be *replaced easily*) and high **cohesion** (one module should do *one job* only), clear dependencies and explicit assumptions

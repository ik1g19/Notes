### Key Characteristics of a JavaBean

1. **Properties**: A JavaBean typically has fields (properties) that represent its data.
2. **Getter and Setter Methods**: It uses public getter and setter methods to access and modify these properties. For example:

```java
private String name;

public String getName() {
    return name;
}

public void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
}

```

3. **No-Argument Constructor**: A JavaBean typically has a public no-argument constructor for easy instantiation.
4. **Serializable**: It often implements the `Serializable` interface to allow easy serialization.

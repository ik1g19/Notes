# STAR Question

**SITUATION:** During my internship at Audioscenic, we were collecting data on different lenses and camera types for spatial audio speakers, but we lacked a way to visualize the data effectively.

**ACTIONS:** I took the initiative to develop a GUI data visualization program using Python Qt, which allowed us to better interpret and analyse the collected data using 3D spatial data visualization and frame-by-frame face landmark analysis.

**RESULTS:** My supervisors were impressed with the program, and it was adopted for internal use, enhancing our data analysis process.

# Please list any other academic or non-academic achievements

During my University experience and also my personal study I have generated a lot of notes for personal use, these notes are accessible on my personal website.

Iâ€™m proud of this project because it serves as both a learning resource for myself and a potential reference for others. I take my notes in Markdown format and use a static site generator to create the site, which I host on GitHub Pages (http://isaacklugman.com/Notes-Quartz/)

# Please describe your experience working as a team

In my second year of University, I was part of a team of five where we developed a JavaFX GUI for a fictional client to display SQL-loaded metrics whilst practising Agile Development techniques. Throughout this project, we created a project backlog to outline user requirements, held regular sprint reviews, and conducted frequent scrums, which fostered clear communication and ensured that everyone was aligned on our goals.

Later, in my fourth year, I worked on a more complex project involving multi-person 3D pose estimation. This required us to integrate data from an omni-directional camera and mmWave radars, and to visualize this data using Open3D. Collaborating in this project taught me the importance of flexibility and creative problem-solving, as we navigated technical challenges and ensured effective integration of our systems.
